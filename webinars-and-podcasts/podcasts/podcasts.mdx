  They discuss Hazel’s origins, its role in simplifying advisor workflows, and the standards that keep client data secure. From automating meeting prep to identifying follow-up opportunities, Hazel is designed to give advisors time back while improving the client experience.

  Advisors will learn how this technology evolved from a startup idea into a core Altruist product—and why the future of advice should feel more efficient, personal, and human.
