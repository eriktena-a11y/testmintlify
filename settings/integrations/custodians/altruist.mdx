Connect your custodial accounts to access portfolio data, holdings, and transaction history directly within Hazel.

  Hazel does not import contacts/households from your custodian at this time. Custodial data is read only, meaning Hazel cannot complete actions or make changes on your custodial data.

## Setting up the Hazel \<\> Altruist Custodial Integration

Log in to Hazel. Head to Settings / Integrations and connect to Altruist.

Enter your Altruist login credentials and you'll be connected. Once you've done so, you can head into Ask Hazel and ask questions about your custodial data as it pertains to a household.

## Use Cases

Hazel has read-only access to your custodial data in Altruist.

At the moment, Hazel works best when you ask questions about a particular account, or household, as opposed to questions that need aggregation across households.

Firm-wide awareness on your custodial data is coming in Q1 2026.

### Examples you can try today

- Show me the Brito household accounts, balances, last transactions, and beneficiaries.

- Based on my last meeting with the Johnson, should I rebalance their portfolio?

  ![Altruistintegrationusecase2](/images/altruistintegrationusecase2.gif)
- "List the beneficiaries for the Smith household."
- "What are their accounts and balances?"
- "Build a performance summary for this household"
- "What’s the RMD status for their accounts?"

## Altruist Integration FAQ

### Can I make changes to my Altruist data within Hazel?

No. Hazel has read-only access to your custodial data in Altruist.

### Do my team members have access to view my Altruist data?

In chat, no. Chat only relies on individual account data, meaning you have to connect to your Altruist account to view any custodial data.

In meeting agendas, perhaps. Meeting prep and agendas rely on the calendar event owner's altruist connection, so your Altruist account data could be shared if other Hazel team members in your firm have access to the same meeting via the household participant permission. [More on household permissions here.](https://www.notion.so/Members-2620935ca9a98049b59dc2d930bf408f?pvs=21)

### I connected Hazel to Altruist but it is not populating my Altruist contacts. Why?

We can only pull contacts from your CRM at this time, not Altruist.

The Altruist integration is completely separate from contacts. Meaning if you go into chat today and ask it for custodial data, it would fetch the appropriate Altruist contact and the relevant details.
