## Welcome to Hazel!

Hazel is designed to be your AI assistant — helping you prioritize, organize, and stay ahead of client needs. To unlock Hazel’s full potential, the first step is connecting your CRM and email. Once synced, Hazel brings in your client details and communications so it can highlight what matters most, when it matters most.

With Hazel connected, you’ll no longer spend time digging through CRM records or searching emails before a meeting. Instead, Hazel surfaces tasks, emails, and meetings that deserve your attention and organizes them on your Your Day, Prioritized page. You’ll also see this intelligence in Chat, the Notetaker, and Contacts.
