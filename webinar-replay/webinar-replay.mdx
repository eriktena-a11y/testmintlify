  In this session, you’ll see how Hazel connects to the Altruist custodial platform — a first for the industry — unlocking several powerful use cases, including the ability to:

  - Pull information from Altruist on contacts, households, accounts, balances, and beneficiaries
  - Compare meeting notes to household custodial data to confirm whether a portfolio is properly allocated, among other things
  - Include a portfolio overview as part of meeting agendas and notes
  - Use custodial information to draft email responses to client questions (coming soon)

  You’ll also hear from Yohance Harrison, BFA, founder of Money Script Wealth, who shared how his firm uses Hazel to save over 75 hours per month by automating prep, follow-up, and communication.

  This webinar also highlights Hazel’s commitment to secure, private AI, including our Zero Data Retention (ZDR) agreements with LLM providers — ensuring your data is never stored or used to train models.

  Plus, get a sneak peek at Hazel’s roadmap for the rest of 2025 and into early 2026.
