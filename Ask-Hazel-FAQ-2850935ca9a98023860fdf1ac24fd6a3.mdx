<Accordion title="Can I make changes to my Altruist data within Hazel?">
  No, you cannot edit your Altruist data within Hazel. Hazel has read-only access to your custodial data in Altruist.
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="Do my team members have access to view my Altruist data?">
  In chat, no. Chat only relies on individual account data, meaning you have to connect to your Altruist account connected to view any custodial data.

  In meeting agendas, perhaps. Meeting prep and agendas rely on the calendar event owner's Altruist connection, so your Altruist account data could be shared if other Hazel team members in your firm have access to the same meeting via the household participant permission. More on household permissions here.
