## Member Roles and Permissions

Hazel supports three distinct roles within a firm: Owner, Advisor, and Assistant. Each role determines what level of access a team member has to Hazel’s features and firm settings.

### Role Comparison

### Owner

<Warning>
  Hazel does not import existing roles and permissions from external data sources. It is up to the Owner to edit household permissions for the organization.

</Warning>

The Owner seat is designed to manage the Hazel account and control firm-wide permissions.

Admin capabilities: Invite and remove members, manage firm settings, and control who can see which Households and Contacts.

Feature access: Full access to all Hazel features, including meeting recording.

Use case: Owners can use Hazel’s chat to instantly access any client data, prepare and debrief meetings, record meetings, send emails, and sync notes and tasks back to the CRM — while also administering the team’s overall Hazel setup.

### Advisor

The Advisor seat gives individual advisors full access to Hazel’s productivity tools without administrative controls.

Admin capabilities: None — advisors cannot manage members or firm settings.

Feature access: Full access to Hazel features, including recording meetings.

Use case: Advisors can record meetings, prepare and debrief meetings, access client data in seconds using Hazel’s chat, send client emails directly, and ensure notes and follow-up tasks sync back to the CRM

### Assistant

The Assistant seat is designed to support Owners and Advisors with meeting prep, follow-ups, and day-to-day client management.

Admin capabilities: None — assistants cannot manage members or firm settings.

Feature access: Limited — assistants cannot record meetings, but can access Hazel’s chat, view meeting records created by Owners/Advisors, and use synced notes and tasks to support client work.

Use case: Assistants can prepare and follow up on meetings, draft emails, and leverage Hazel’s chat as a knowledge base to support client relationships.
