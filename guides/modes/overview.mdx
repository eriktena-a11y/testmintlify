## What Are Modes?

Modes are a **specialized version of Ask Hazel**, designed to help you work through complex, focused tasks with greater consistency and clarity.

Ask Hazel is our general-purpose chat experience. It uses Hazel’s AI engine to access your connected data and advanced language models so you can analyze information, explore scenarios, and get work done through conversation.

Modes build on that foundation by adding **structure and intent**. Instead of starting from a blank chat every time, a Mode lets you define how Hazel should behave for a specific type of work. By combining clear instructions and background knowledge, Modes help Hazel stay focused on what you’re trying to accomplish—without requiring you to repeat or refine prompts over and over.

## How Modes Work

Modes use the same AI engine as Ask Hazel, but with additional guidance that shapes how Hazel thinks and responds.

Each Mode is defined by:

- **Description** – what the Mode is designed to help with
- **Instructions** – how Hazel should approach problems and respond
- **Knowledge** – files, links, or documents that provide background context

When you use a Mode, Hazel:

- Has access to **all data you’ve connected** (CRM, email, calendar, meeting notes, custodial data)
- Automatically uses relevant data when needed to answer your questions
- Applies the Mode’s instructions and knowledge to stay focused and consistent

Modes do **not** remember past conversations. Each chat starts fresh, but because the instructions and knowledge are always in place, you can expect more reliable and repeatable results than a standard chat.

## What Makes Modes Different from Ask Hazel

Ask Hazel is flexible and open-ended. Modes are **purpose-built**.

Modes are designed for deeper, more advanced work and unlock capabilities that aren’t available in a regular Ask Hazel chat, including:

- Multi-step reasoning that chains analysis together in a single conversation
- Generative interfaces that present information visually, not just as text
- Code execution for advanced calculations and analysis
- Structured outputs such as reports, summaries, and client-ready materials

If Ask Hazel is your starting point, Modes are what you use when the work requires precision, structure, and depth.

## Using Modes in Ask Hazel

Modes are selected **before** you start a chat.

- When starting a conversation, you choose the Mode you want to use
- Each chat remains in the selected Mode for its entire duration
- By default, no Mode is selected—you intentionally choose one each time
- Modes are available to all eligible users in your firm

This ensures that each conversation begins with the right context and expectations in place.

## What Modes Can — and Cannot — Do

Modes are powerful, but they are designed to support thinking and analysis—not automation.

### Modes can:

- Analyze and visualize complex data
- Chain multiple steps of reasoning in one conversation
- Generate reports, PDFs, and structured outputs
- Draft client communications and internal documents
- Produce downloadable files, including PDFs

### Modes cannot:

- Take actions on your behalf
- Send emails or messages
- Schedule meetings, reminders, or tasks
- Update or write back to CRM or other systems
- Run workflows or background automations
- Remember past conversations

Modes help you **think, analyze, and create**. You remain in control of what happens next.

## When to Use a Mode

Modes are best used when the work requires focus and structure.

You should consider using a Mode when:

- You’re working through a complex scenario that involves multiple steps
- You want consistent outputs without rewriting prompts
- You need deeper analysis or visualizations
- You’re working within a specialized domain, such as tax or investments
- You want client-ready outputs based on connected data

For quick questions or open-ended exploration, Ask Hazel is often enough. For everything else, Modes are built to go deeper.

## What’s Next

Modes are an advanced capability designed to push what’s possible with AI in wealth management.

As new Modes become available, each will have its own dedicated guide with detailed instructions and examples. This page serves as a foundational overview to help you understand what Modes are, how they work, and when to use them.

When you’re ready, choose a Mode and start exploring.
