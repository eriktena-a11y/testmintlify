## Your day, Prioritized

The Overview page is designed to be your command center. Instead of bouncing between inboxes, calendars, and task lists, everything you need is displayed in one place. Hazel will prioritize your day.

This page surfaces your most relevant emails, tasks, and meetings so you can focus on what requires attention, while Hazel keeps the rest in view. You can filter by the different areas, or Ask Hazel anything.

### Tasks

Hazel prioritizes your tasks based on importance and deadlines, only presenting those that are top of mind. If you’d like to see more tasks, Ask Hazel to generate a list of tasks, globally or client specific.

### Emails

Your most important client emails are highlighted so you never miss a critical message. Only emails from contacts in your CRM are pulled into Hazel, eliminating unwanted distractions.

Hazel will then pull relevant contact details to help you draft intelligent responses, ensuring every reply is timely and informed.
