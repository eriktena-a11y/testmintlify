# Welcome to Hazel!

Hazel brings your client world into focus so you can move faster, stay organized, and show up prepared for every conversation.

Hazel gathers the details across your CRM, recent client communications, and custodial data, then turns them into a clear, usable view of what matters right now. At the center is Hazel’s intelligence layer, built to connect the dots across client profiles, conversations, and account context. With Ask Hazel, you can interact with your data in plain language and get clear, actionable answers. Ask for a quick client recap before a call, the latest activity across a household, or for advanced tax analysis and scenario planning. Hazel pulls the relevant context together and presents it in a way that is easy to use, not just easy to read.

For Altruist firms, custodial data is now available in the same conversational experience. You can ask questions about balances, holdings, recent changes, and more, and get responses grounded in the latest available account information.

This is what it feels like to run your day with everything you need at your fingertips.

By Setting up your CRM and Email, Hazel can…

- Pull together client history in seconds so you’re always prepared.
- Proactively highlight follow-ups, deadlines, and opportunities.
- Give you a daily prioritized view of tasks, meetings, and emails.
- Eliminate the need to jump between tools — everything lives in Hazel.

- Ensure your daily priorities are up to date.

In order to do so, we need permission to view events on your calendar. And we need permission to read, compose, and send emails on your behalf. [More on Email & Calendar integrations here.](https://www.notion.so/Integrations-2620935ca9a980b9ad62fda8b4c06028?pvs=21)
