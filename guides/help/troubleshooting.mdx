### Ask Hazel Troubleshooting

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Hazel is no longer responding to my in a chat thread.">
    Hazel may fail to respond if she reaches chat limits, which happens if the chat thread is extensive. The longer the chat thread and the more files you add to a single thread over time, the higher likelihood it is to max out its token limits. Once a chat fails, it will no longer accept responses.

    <Tip>
      It's best to switch chats when you are working through different topics. You can do so by clicking on `New Chat` in the top right corner of Ask Hazel.
    </Tip>

  <Accordion title="The 'Ideas' link is not working. I am getting the following message, 'Hazel's feedback is private. Log in to see if you have access.'">
    The Ideas page is how we track feedback, through Canny's feedback portal.

    If you are getting the following message "Hazel's feedback is private. Log in to see if you have access," try clearing your cookies/data on the Hazel page for the Canny connection. Then try again by refreshing and re-clicking the Ideas button within Hazel.

  <Accordion title="I connected Hazel to Altruist but it is not populating my Altruist contacts. Why?">
    Hazel relies on your CRM connection to pull contacts, not Altruist.

    The Altruist integration is completely separate from contacts. Meaning if you go into chat today and ask it for custodial data, it would fetch the appropriate Altruist contact and the relevant details, but they would not be listed as a Contact within Hazel.

### Meetings Troubleshooting

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Resetting Notetaker">
    You may need to reset Hazel's note taker on various occasions:

    - Hazel was not admitted and left the waiting room.
    - Hazel was denied / kicked out of meeting, whether on purpose or on accident.
    - Hazel experienced connectivity issues.

    **How to Reset Hazel from Overview page:** Click on the menu icon for the meeting and click 'Reset Notetaker.' This will clear out any previous data and treat the meeting as if it were brand new.

  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Hazel join a Zoom call I was in, but afterward there was no transcript.">
    If Hazel joined a Zoom call but afterward there was no transcript, it is likely that the host has their **global** local recording setting enabled, but they can't grant participants permission to record locally, which is needed for a bot to record.

    **How to fix:** Host should review and enable the following Zoom settings:

    1. In Recording tab, verify that `Internal meeting participants` and `External meeting participants` are checked.

       ![Troubleshootzoom1](/images/troubleshootzoom1.png)
    2. In Recording tab, verify that Record to computer files is toggled on.

       ![Troubleshootzoom2](/images/troubleshootzoom2.png)
    3. While in a Zoom Meeting, verify that `Request Local Recording` Permission is turned on.

       ![Troubleshootzoom3](/images/troubleshootzoom3.png)
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="How did not join my Zoom call, nor was she in the waiting room, why?">
    If Hazel did not join my Zoom call, nor was she in the waiting room, it is likely that the host has their **global** permissions set to not allow anonymous users, or users not invited to the meeting, to join the meeting. This is needed for a bot to record.

    **How to fix:** Host should enable this setting by allowing Anonymous users to join.

    ![Troubleshootzoom2](/images/troubleshootzoom2.png)
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Hazel did not join my Google Meet call, nor was she in the waiting room. Why?">
    If Hazel did not join my Google Meet call, nor was she in the waiting room, it is likely that the host has their **global** permissions set to not allow anonymous users, or users not invited to the meeting, to join the meeting. This is needed for a bot to record.

    **How to fix:** Host should review and enable the following Google settings:

    1. Under **Meeting Access \> Meeting Access type**: verify that the `Anyone with the meeting link can ask to join` checkbox is checked.

    ![Troubleshootgoogle1](/images/troubleshootgoogle1.png)

    If this box is unchecked, then **all anonymous participants and participants not on the calendar invite** will be automatically declined when attempting to join the meeting.

    This will appear as the "You can't join this meeting" screen from the bot's perspective:

    ![Troubleshootgoogle2](/images/troubleshootgoogle2.png)

    <Info>
      To manage meeting access permissions for your entire organization, the host (admin) follow these steps:

      1. Go to the Google Meet admin center.
      2. Expand **Host Controls \> Meeting Access**.
      3. Under **Who needs to ask to join**, select **Open**.

  <Accordion title="Hazel did not join my Microsoft Teams call, nor was she in the waiting room. Why?">
    If Hazel did not join my Microsoft Teams call, nor was she in the waiting room, it is likely that the host has their **global** permissions set to not allow anonymous users, or users not invited to the meeting, to join the meeting. This is needed for a bot to record.

    **How to fix:** To manage anonymous meeting join for your entire organization, the host (admin) should follow these steps:

    1. Go to the Teams admin center.
    2. Expand **Meetings** \> **Meeting settings**.
    3. Under **Meeting Join and Lobby:** verify that the `Anonymous users can join a meeting` setting is toggled to On.
    4. Save your updates.

  <Accordion title="I accidentally synced the meeting notes to the wrong Household/Contact. What should I do?">
    If you accidentally synced notes to the wrong Household/Contact, here's what you need to do:

    1. Within the Meetings page, remove the incorrect profile from the attendees and then add the correct profile.

       ![Troubleshootsynctowrong HH1](/images/troubleshootsynctowrongHH1.png)
    2. Once the correct profile is selected, click on 'Sync to CRM' and re-sync the notes to the correct profile. Be sure to review the title, household/contact/tags section before you sync to CRM.

       ![Troubleshootsynctowrong HH2](/images/troubleshootsynctowrongHH2.png)
    3. You'll need to delete the notes from the incorrect profile within your CRM so the incorrect meeting data is not associate the the incorrect household. Head to the Household, then within the Activity section, find the note, and click Delete.

  <Accordion title="How do I upload a meeting that failed to upload?">
    To upload a meeting that failed to upload, navigate to the meeting in Hazel, click `Record` and select `Upload Saved Recording`. If we have any reording data on file, we will upload it.

    ![Troubleshootbrowserfailedtoprocess](/images/troubleshootbrowserfailedtoprocess.png)

    If you do not see an `Upload Saved Recording`, then we do not have any meeting data on file and the recording was lost. [_Reach out to support@hazel.ai for further support._](mailto:support@hazel.ai)

    <Note>
      Our visibility into browser recorded meetings is minimal due to browser related issues (different browsers, version updates, popup blocker settings, mic settings, etc). If there's a failure with the browser, the internet, or unforseen events, then there's a high chance of loss. The best option for in person meetings is to use our iOS app for recording.

  <Accordion title="How do I prevent meetings recorded via Browser from failing to process?">
    Our visibility into browser recorded meetings is minimal due to browser related issues (different browsers, version updates, popup blocker settings, mic settings, etc). If there's a failure with the browser, the internet, or unforseen events, then there's a high chance of loss.

    [_Reach out to support@hazel.ai for further support._](mailto:support@hazel.ai)

    <Note>
      **One very important thing to keep in mind if you use browser recording:**

      Do not switch tabs while the browser is processing. If you do, your browser may fail to fully cache the recording due to their handling/refreshing/throttling on 'inactive tabs', which may corrupt the file and make it unprocessable.

      Best thing to do would be to stay on the Hazel screen for a few seconds until the recording finishes processing and moves to the uploading screen before switching tabs. It's this processing period that is key for the browser to cache your recording.

      ![Troubleshootbrowsertip1](/images/troubleshootbrowsertip1.png)

      Once the browser has processed the recording, it still needs to upload the recording to Hazel. Do not close the tab until the recording has finished uploading. You may switch tabs at this stage. Once the file has finished uploading to Hazel, then we have a file on record to process, reprocess, and download as needed.

### Email Troubleshooting
<AccordionGroup>
<Accordion title="My signature is not HTML.">
  ![ET.signaturenothtml](/images/image\(8\)-1.png)

  Leverage Hazel’s chat to turn your non-HTML signature into HTML text by:

  1. Copying your email signature into a word document
  2. Attach the document + the following prompt into Ask Hazel `Hazel, turn the email signature in the document attached into HTML text`
  3. Copy the HTML text into Settings → HTML Email Signature
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="My logo is not loading in the signature.">
  ![Image (10)](/images/image\(10\).png)

  It’s most likely that your HTML email signature includes an image that is not public. Images in your HTML email signature need to be on a publicly accessible url link that points to an image source.

  Within your HTML email signature, verify by:

  1. CTRL+F `img` and find the `img src` section of text
  2. Replace everything in “`double quotes`” with a publicly stored image

     <Info>
       Ex. img src="/41235/file_attachments/5952192” → img src="https://hazel.ai/images/logo-footer.svg"
     </Info>

  ![Image (9)](/images/image\(9\).png)

  If you don't have a publicly stored email, you can upload a logo in Settings → Account → Firm Information, right click on the logo once its loaded, and ‘Copy Image Address’.
