title: "How Hazel’s notetaker works"
---

1. Hazel can record via the following methods:
   - Sending a notetaker to your Zoom, Microsoft Teams, Google Meet meeting
   - Capturing the audio through the Hazel web app or any voice recorder app
2. Assign a Household/Contact to the Meeting to pair the data to the client.
   - Once you connect your CRM and Email, Hazel will auto-assign the appropriate Household/Contact.
   - If a Household/Contact is not auto-assigned, it’s likely because we could not associate the email to an existing relationship in your CRM. **Click on the ‘+’ icon in the top right and manually associate a Household/Contact.**
3. Assign a Meeting Type
   1. You can instruct Hazel through prompting, similar to how you train a Paraplanner on what notes to capture. Simply edit the meeting note templates or create new meeting types based on the information you’d like to capture. This is not a requirement, but helps train Hazel on your firms processes.
