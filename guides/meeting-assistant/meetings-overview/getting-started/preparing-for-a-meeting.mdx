<Warning>
  It is important to assign Attendees so that other team members that are not on the calendar invite can view the meeting. If a Household/Contact is not auto-assigned, it’s likely because we could not associate the email to an existing relationship in your CRM.

  **Click on the ‘+’ icon in the top right and manually associate a Household/Contact.**

  [Please review the ‘Setting yourself up for success’ section above.](/guides/meeting-assistant/meetings-overview/set-up-for-success)
</Warning>

Once you connect your CRM and Email, Hazel will auto-assign the appropriate Household/Contact, and prepare an agenda and a reminder email.

Hazel will analyze previous meetings, tasks, emails, and CRM data to present you with information that is relevant for your upcoming meeting.

The agenda is prepared based on the **Meeting Type** that is selected for the meeting. A meeting type is a prompt template that instructs Hazel on what to prep and what she should capture based on the specific kind of client conversation. You can fully [customize a meeting type](/guides/meeting-assistant/meeting-details/meeting-types/customizing-meeting-types)’s agenda by editing the sections, prompts, and fields Hazel pulls into the pre-meeting overview, creating a consistent, repeatable prep flow that matches how your firm runs each conversation.

Hazel will also create a **Reminder Email** for you to review and send your client.
