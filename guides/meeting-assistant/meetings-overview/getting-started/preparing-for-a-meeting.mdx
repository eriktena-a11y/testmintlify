<Warning>
  It is important to assign Attendees so that other team members that are not on the calendar invite can view the meeting. If a Household/Contact is not auto-assigned, it’s likely because we could not associate the email to an existing relationship in your CRM.

  **Click on the ‘+’ icon in the top right and manually associate a Household/Contact.**

  [Please review the ‘Setting yourself up for success’ section above.](https://www.notion.so/Meetings-Details-2630935ca9a9801c9b45cb1f79969f13?pvs=21)
</Warning>

Once you connect your CRM and Email, Hazel will auto-assign the appropriate Household/Contact, and prepare an agenda and a reminder email.

Hazel will analyze previous meetings, tasks, emails, and CRM data to present you with information that is relevant for your upcoming meeting.

Hazel will also create a **Reminder Email** for you to review and send your client.
