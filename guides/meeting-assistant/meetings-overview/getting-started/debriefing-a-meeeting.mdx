After a meeting, Hazel helps you turn any conversation into a clear, actionable debrief. Hazel pulls the important takeaways from the conversation based on the **Meeting Type** that was selected, capturing the desired details you need from a call. You don’t have to replay the call or build a recap from scratch. In a few minutes, you can review everything in one place and finish the meeting with clarity for your team and your client.

<Warning>
  If a Household/Contact is not assigned, we cannot sync notes and to the proper Household/Contact in your CRM. **Click on the ‘+’ icon in the top right and manually associate a Household/Contact.**
