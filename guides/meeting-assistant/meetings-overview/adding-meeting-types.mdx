1. **Navigate to Settings → Meeting Settings**
   - From your Hazel dashboard, click on **Settings** and then select **Meeting Settings**.
   - This is where all your existing meeting types are stored and where you can manage or create new ones.
2. **Add a New Meeting Type**
   - Click the **“Add Meeting Type”** button.
   - This is where you can name your new meeting type and begin customizing it to fit your workflow.

   <Tip>
     If you don’t want to start from scratch, you can duplicate the ‘General Meeting’ type prompts by clicking on the Add Meeting Type button, naming it, then clicking Save. Find the newly created meeting type, click ‘Edit’, and it’ll have default prompts ready for editing.
   </Tip>
3. **Customize Your Prompts**
   - Each meeting type can be tailored by editing its prompts. Hazel uses these prompts to generate structured outputs. You can set up prompts for:
     - **Agenda** – Define what should be prepared before the meeting. For example, highlight goals, discussion topics, or referral opportunities.
     - **Reminder Email** – Customize the tone and content of reminders sent to attendees before the meeting.
     - **Meeting Notes** – Guide Hazel on what information to capture during the meeting (e.g., goals, action items, key decisions).
     - **Follow-Up Email** – Personalize the post-meeting summary email that Hazel generates for clients or team members.

4. **Match on Key Phrases**

   ![Matchkeyphrase](/images/matchkeyphrase.png)
   - You can include keywords or phrases that Hazel will use to automatically identify and match the correct meeting type.
   - For example, adding “annual review” as a key phrase ensures that when those words appear in a calendar invite, Hazel automatically categorizes the meeting as an **Annual Review**.
