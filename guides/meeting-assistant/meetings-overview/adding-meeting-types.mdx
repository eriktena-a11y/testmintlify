3. **Customize Your Prompts**
   - Each meeting type can be tailored by editing its prompts. Hazel uses these prompts to generate structured outputs. You can set up prompts for:
     - **Agenda** – Define what should be prepared before the meeting. For example, highlight goals, discussion topics, or referral opportunities.
     - **Reminder Email** – Customize the tone and content of reminders sent to attendees before the meeting.
     - **Meeting Notes** – Guide Hazel on what information to capture during the meeting (e.g., goals, action items, key decisions).
     - **Follow-Up Email** – Personalize the post-meeting summary email that Hazel generates for clients or team members.

4. **Match on Key Phrases**

   - You can include keywords or phrases that Hazel will use to automatically identify and match the correct meeting type.
   - For example, adding “annual review” as a key phrase ensures that when those words appear in a calendar invite, Hazel automatically categorizes the meeting as an **Annual Review**.
