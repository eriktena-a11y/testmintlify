### Hazel can record via the following methods

<Accordion title="Recording Online Meetings">
  Once you connect your Calendar, Hazel will be automatically scheduled to join calendar events with meeting links available. At the time of the event, Hazel will be in the waiting room waiting for you to admit it.

  We support online video recording with Zoom, Microsoft Teams, and Google Meet.

  You can verify Hazel will join your online meetings by clicking on the menu icon for the particular meeting you're curious about. If ‘Take Notes’ is on, then Hazel will join your meeting.
