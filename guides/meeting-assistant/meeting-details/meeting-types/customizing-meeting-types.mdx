title: "Customizing Meeting Types"
---

Meeting type prompts let you customize what output to capture and how to present it for each meeting. When you edit a meeting type prompt, you’re defining the instructions Hazel will follow to generate the agenda, reminder email, meeting notes, and follow-up email for that meeting type.

You can keep it simple by using a single prompt to create an all-in-one summary, or get more specific by adding multiple prompts separated by three dashes (`---`). Each prompt runs independently against the meeting transcript, allowing you to control _exactly_ what Hazel returns—such as a narrative recap, a Q&A section, action items, or a financial data table.

Think of prompts the same way you’d train a paraplanner: by telling them what details matter and how you want notes structured. Editing meeting note templates or creating new meeting types isn’t required, but it helps align Hazel with your firm’s processes and ensures your notes consistently reflect what’s most important to you.

<Accordion title="Intro to Prompting for Meeting Types">
  ## Single Prompts

  For single prompts, only one prompt is run to generate the meeting notes.

  ### Example Single Prompts

  **Default Prompt**

  <Info>
    Generate a detailed summary of the meeting using sections & bullet points covering all topics discussed. Use a narrative style, be detailed, and include any outcomes or conclusions made. Be thorough, but consolidate notes under a few major topics.
  </Info>
  **Paragraph-Based Narrative Style Prompt**

  <Info>
    Generate detailed notes of the meeting using paragraphs and a narrative style. Be detailed, and include any outcomes or conclusions made.
  </Info>
  ## Multi Prompts

  To run multiple prompts for detailed summaries, in the editor, simply add three dashes (`-` `-` `-`) and a divider should appear. Below it, you can add a new prompt.

  Each prompt will run independently, and be added to the end of the notes generated before it. Think of each prompt as an separate instruction for Hazel.

  ### Example Multi Prompts

  **Basic Notes, Q&A, and a Financial Data Table Prompt**

  <Info>
    Generate a detailed summary of the meeting using sections & bullet points covering all topics discussed. Use a narrative style, be detailed, and include any outcomes or conclusions made. Be thorough, but consolidate notes under a few major topics.

    ---

    Add a Q&A section which covers the most important questions asked in the meeting, and the corresponding responses. If the same question is asked multiple times, only include it once. Format the Q&A section using bold text for the question, and regular text for the answer.

    [EXAMPLE FORMAT]

    **Q: What is the current interest rate on my savings account?**

    A: The current interest rate on your savings account is 0.25%.

    **Q: What is the current interest rate on my checking account?**

    A: The current interest rate on your savings account is 0.25%.

  ## Template Based Prompts

  Using a template in prompts can help standardize the output, while allowing AI to insert relevant context.
