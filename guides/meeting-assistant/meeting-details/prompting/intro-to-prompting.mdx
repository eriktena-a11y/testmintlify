## Multi Prompts

To run multiple prompts for detailed summaries, in the editor, simply add three dashes (`-` `-` `-`) and a divider should appear. Below it, you can add a new prompt.

Each prompt will run independently, and be added to the end of the notes generated before it. Think of each prompt as an separate instruction for Hazel.
