Great results start with great prompts. The clearer your request, the smarter your AI assistant can be. We’ve gathered some quick tips and tricks for writing prompts that get right to what you’re trying to accomplish:

1. Start with the end in mind.

   > ❌ Instead of: “Here’s an example...” within the prompt sections
   >
   > ✅ If you already have examples you’ve used before, drop them into Hazel’s chat. Hazel will look at your example, work backwards, and suggest a prompt that clearly tells it what you want. Take that prompt and drop it into the appropriate prompt section for better results.
2. Provide concrete examples: Offer Hazel existing examples of what you want to see, illustrating ideal outcomes.

   > ❌ Instead of: “Write a reminder email with bullet points of topics we’ll cover.”
   >
   > ✅ Try: “Write a reminder email for an upcoming meeting. We’ll be discussing one or multiple, of the following topics: Investments, Tax, Estate, Insurance, Cash Flow. Based on outstanding client tasks, advisor tasks, and previous meeting notes, tailor the reminder email to address this/these topics to address in the upcoming meeting. For example, if the main focus is 'Investments,' the reminder should highlight any relevant investment-related items. Here’s an example of the tone and structure I want to follow: …’”
3. Include relevant context: Help Hazel grasp the bigger picture to ensure responses match your broader goals.

   > ❌ Instead of: “Summarize the notes and provide next steps”
   >
   > ✅ Try: Ex. Discovery meeting: “This was a meeting where we discussed goals and observations of future financial decisions and recommendations. The next step in the process is to take the findings from this conversation and provide recommendations needed to achieve their goals. Generate a detailed summary of the discovery meeting using sections & bullet points covering all topics discussed. Include next steps based on the most relevant topics that will be addressed on the next meeting.”
4. Define a clear role: Specify roles to ensure the AI’s tone, depth, and accuracy align with your expectations.

   > ❌ Instead of: “Avoid jargon and always use the clients name.”
   >
   > ✅ Try: “Key instructions:
   > 1. **Use Specific Names and Details:** Refer to each client by name as needed and be as specific as possible about the context (e.g., names of children, account types, roles, specific financial goals).
   > 2. **Keep the Tone Warm, Professional, and Clear:** Write in a tone that’s professional yet conversational and easy to understand.Avoid overly technical language unless you provide a clear, simple explanation. Never use financial jargon without context or clarity.
