title: "How Hazel’s notetaker works"
---

Hazel’s notetaker supports the full meeting workflow—**prep, capture, and debrief**—so advisors can walk into every client conversation informed and walk out with clear next steps. Before the meeting, Hazel surfaces an agenda-style overview of what’s most relevant to review going in (recent activity, key details, and open items), helping you focus the conversation. During the meeting, Hazel captures the discussion in the background. After the call, Hazel produces a structured debrief with the meeting summary, decisions, action items, and follow-ups based on what matters most to you.

1. Hazel can record via the following methods:
   - Sending a notetaker to your Zoom, Microsoft Teams, Google Meet meeting
   - Capturing the audio through the Hazel web app or any voice recorder app
2. Assign a Household/Contact to the Meeting to pair the data to the client.
   - Once you connect your CRM and Email, Hazel will auto-assign the appropriate Household/Contact.
   - If a Household/Contact is not auto-assigned, it’s likely because we could not associate the email to an existing relationship in your CRM. **Click on the ‘+’ icon in the top right and manually associate a Household/Contact.**
3. Assign a Meeting Type
   - You can instruct Hazel through prompting, similar to how you train a Paraplanner on what notes to capture. Simply edit the meeting note templates or create new meeting types based on the information you’d like to capture. This is not a requirement, but helps train Hazel on your firms processes.
