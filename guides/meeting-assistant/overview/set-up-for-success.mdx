Follow these tips to get to most out of Hazel's Meeting Assistant.

- **Check attendees** – This ensures the meeting is associated with the correct household, unlocking the ability for other team members to view the meeting and associating that meeting to a Household so Ask Hazel can access it. This connection is super powerful for keeping conversations organized and accessible.
- **Select the meeting type** – There are five [default meeting types](/guides/meeting-assistant/meeting-details/meeting-types/default-meeting-types) available, each designed to provide different styles of notes. Choosing the right one ensures the notes are tailored to the type of meeting you’re running.
- **Meeting Status** – You can update the meeting status from **Ready For Review, Complete, or Reset Meeting Data.**
  - **Ready For Review → Complete**: Stay organized by clearly showing what’s been finished and what’s still left to review.
  - **Reset Meeting Data**: Doing this will reset the meeting complete. All data will be lost.
