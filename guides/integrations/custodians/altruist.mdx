## Setting up the Hazel x Altruist Custodial Integration

Log in to Hazel. Head to Settings / Integrations and connect to Altruist.

Enter your Altruist login credentials and you'll be connected. Once you've done so, you can head into Ask Hazel and ask questions about your custodial data as it pertains to a household.

## Use Cases

Hazel has read-only access to your custodial data in Altruist.

At the moment, Hazel works best when you ask questions about a particular account, or household, as opposed to questions that need aggregation across households.
