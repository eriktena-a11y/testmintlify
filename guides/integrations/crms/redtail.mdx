Connect your Redtail account to give Hazel access to your contacts, households, tasks, and notes. With a bidirectional sync, updates made in Hazel appear in your CRM, and changes in your CRM are reflected back in Hazel, keeping your data consistent and up to date across both platforms.

<Note>
  Hazel does not import existing roles and permissions from your CRM. It is up to the Owner to edit household permissions for the organization. Learn more about editing household permissions.

The Redtail integration provides a bi-directional sync for: Tasks, Notes, Contacts, and Households. Hazel instantaneously syncs data to Redtail, and Redtail syncs data every 24 hours to Hazel. Upon the initial sync, Hazel partially backfills historical data based on Redtail’s sync guidelines and imports all contacts with no filters applied.
