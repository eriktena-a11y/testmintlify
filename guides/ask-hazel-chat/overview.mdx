Hazel is designed to help you think, plan, and achieve outcomes with speed and clarity, so you can stay engaged and be proactive. Instead of spending time digging through files, emails, and notes, Hazel anticipates what you need in seconds.

Your accumulated data is the knowledge that Hazel uses to surface what matters most, right when you need it — whether that’s prepping for a client meeting, recalling an interaction, or prioritizing an email.

Think of Hazel as your partner that helps you move from “what do I do?” to “here’s what’s next”, all from a simple nudge.

## How Hazel can help you:

### Writing & Communication

- Emails: I can prioritize your client emails and draft intelligent responses using available data.
- Summaries: Paste articles or reports or ask about a previous meeting, and I can turn them into a digestible summary.
- Follow-ups: I can generate reminders or recap emails for teams and clients.

### Research & Analysis

- Document Analysis: Drop in files (like estate documents or tax returns), and I can summarize, highlight observations, or help you break down next steps.
- Quick Explanations: Ask me to break down a new concept in simple terms, or compare options (e.g., tax, political policies, financial planning strategies).
- Industry Insights: I can summarize news or best practices from trusted sources.

### Brainstorming & Creativity

- Idea Generation: Whether it’s marketing ideas or prospecting strategies, I can be your thought partner.
- Problem-Solving: You can describe a challenge, and I’ll suggest different approaches while referencing your clients details on file.
- Content Outlines: For presentations, meeting agendas, or financial planning strategies, I can give you a starting point.

### Planning & Organization

- Daily Priorities: I’ll prioritize your day and update you as items arise.
- Project Outlines: I can help create step-by-step plans or roadmaps.
- Templates: Need a framework for reports, agendas, or documentation? I’ll draft it.
