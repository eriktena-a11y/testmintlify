### Ask Anything

Hazel is designed to handle any type of question — from broad to highly specific. Keep in mind that the more context you provide, the more tailored and detailed Hazel’s answers will be.

**Best practices:**

- Even vague questions will return results, but context (client names, dates, goals) helps Hazel dig deeper and deliver sharper answers.
- Hazel can pull across systems — CRM, Emails, Previous Meetings, Web Search — so you don’t need to worry about where the data lives.
- Don’t worry about perfect phrasing. Hazel understands natural language, so speak as you would to a colleague.
- Use action-oriented prompts like _“Draft,”_ _“Summarize,”_ _“List,”_ or _“Prepare”_ when you want Hazel to create something for you.

<Info>
  Use Hazel like you would an assistant. If you only remember part of a detail — a client’s first name, or that a conversation happened “last month” — that’s enough to start. Hazel will fetch results, and you can refine with follow-ups.

### Guide the Conversation

Think of Hazel like an assistant who remembers the flow of your instructions and connects details across systems. That means you don’t have to repeat client names or details every time — you can ask follow-ups naturally.

**Best practices:**

- Start with a broad request, then narrow down with follow-ups.
- Layer your questions step by step — Hazel keeps track of who and what you’re talking about.
- Be clear on the format you’d like — an email, bullet points, or a meeting agenda.

<Info>
  Hazel shines when you chain together multiple steps — pulling data, analyzing it, and drafting outputs — all in the same conversation. This turns Hazel into a true assistant.

### Build an Additional Layer of Context

Hazel doesn’t just pull from your existing systems — you can also **add your own notes, tables, and files directly into Hazel** to give it richer context. This makes Hazel smarter and more personalized.

**Best practices:**

- Add **files** in the Chat and have Hazel analyze and provide context.
- Add **additional notes or tables** within the **Household section** of Hazel. Use this extra context to power chats, prep, and agendas going forward.
- Think of it as giving Hazel additional information about a client that isn’t stored anywhere else but in your head.

<Info>
  The more client-specific context you add, the more Hazel has to work with. As Hazel receives new data — from emails, CRM, or meetings — it will add it to their client profile. For additional thoughts or context, add your own notes for depth. Over time, Hazel becomes a single source of truth you can rely on for deeper insights and faster prep.
