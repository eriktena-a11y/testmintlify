<Accordion title="Does Hazel match my writing style? Is there a way to set rules where I have a certain tonality and certain words and language I use?">
On the follow up emails, you can tweak the prompt and give it instructions and example quotes of things you'd likely say. By instructing Hazel in the prompt, you can set rules for tones to follow.

As for the email assistant that auto drafts emails on the Today page, there is not prompt or rules you can set today. We're working on improving this experience.
