<Accordion title="Hazel is no longer responding to my in a chat thread.">
  Hazel may fail to respond if she reaches chat limits, which happens if the chat thread is extensive. The longer the chat thread and the more files you add to a single thread over time, the higher likelihood it is to max out its token limits. Once a chat fails, it will no longer accept responses.

  <Tip>
    It's best to switch chats when you are working through different topics. You can do so by clicking on `New Chat` in the top right corner of Ask Hazel.

<Accordion title="The ‘Ideas’ link is not working. How can I access?">
  The Ideas page is how we track feedback, through Canny's feedback portal. 

  If you are getting the following message "Hazel's feedback is private. Log in to see if you have access," try clearing your cookies/data on the Hazel page for the Canny connection. Then try again by refreshing and re-clicking the Ideas button within Hazel.
