If your email signature does not display properly in the preview, it may be due to one or multiple issues. Here’s how to troubleshoot common display issues:

<Accordion title="My signature is not HTML.">
  ![ET.signaturenothtml](/images/image\(8\)-1.png)

  Leverage Hazel’s chat to turn your non-HTML signature into HTML text by:

  1. Copying your email signature into a word document
  2. Attach the document + the following prompt into Ask Hazel `Hazel, turn the email signature in the document attached into HTML text`
  3. Copy the HTML text into Settings → HTML Email Signature
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="My logo is not loading in the signature.">
  ![Image (10)](/images/image\(10\).png)

  It’s most likely that your HTML email signature includes an image that is not public. Images in your HTML email signature need to be on a publicly accessible url link that points to an image source. 

  Within your HTML email signature, verify by:

  1. CTRL+F `img` and find the `img src` section of text
  2. Replace everything in “`double quotes`” with a publicly stored image

     <Info>
       Ex. img src="/41235/file_attachments/5952192” → img src="https://hazel.ai/images/logo-footer.svg"
     </Info>

  If you don't have a publicly stored email, you can upload a logo in Settings → Account → Firm Information, right click on the logo once its loaded, and ‘Copy Image Address’.
